Hello, all, my name is Michael Ryan Brotherton. I will be the tour guide to my life in this short summary.</p> 

<p>I was born and raised in Gainesville, FL, and really want to leave! Anyways, I have 2 siblings: a sister, by the name of Lauren, and a brother, by the name of Andrew. I don't think, throughout my life, I'd come to appreciate them fully until I moved out about a year and a half ago. I, like my dad, am a huge technology nut. Computers are my thing, but I also hold interst in home electronics and video games (more then home electronics :P). Computers, the software development portion, is what I aim to get my degree and a career in. Hardware and all of its many statistics are my 'hobby' of sorts.</p> 

<p>Currently, I work as a bagger at Publix with Betty Jo. Lately I was cross-trained for the cashier position (FINALLY!). It took them almost two years to do it.</p>

<p>As for future plans, other then our careers, we want 2-3 kids, she wants a zoo (cats, dogs, our rabbit, and I swear she will pick up any animal that has fur or is small enough to keep easily), and, in order to do that, a rather large house and/or yard is needed. >.< </p>

<p>That about wraps it up! Be sure to check out the rest of the site and see you at the wedding!</p>
