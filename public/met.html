<p style="font-weight: 700">The following is written from both our perspectives. In an effort to make it less confusing and clarify who is 'speaking,' Michael's words will be in white and Betty Jo's words will be in <def class="bjq">yellow</def>.</p>

<p class="bjq">I met Michael when I started working for Publix as a "Customer Service Associate" aka bagger. He helped train me once I'd gone through the orientation training. He was friendly and had a good sense of humor, a little twisted like mine, but I only thought of him as a pleasant coworker, maybe a friend.</p>


<p>I trained Betty Jo how to do a good portion of her job, but still didn't get to know her very well, considering how quiet she was. I kind of watched her to try to get a feel for what kind of person she was before doing anything, as I think most people would. After six months or so <def class="bjq">(it was more like four to six weeks)</def>, I didn't see her at all. Only later did I find out it was because she got in an accident that forced her to leave work<def class="bjq">(a different story, too long to tell here)</def>. After she came back, they moved her from bagger to cashier because she broke her wrist and couldn't lift much. From then on I tried to bag for her , talking as much as I could, and joking around to let myself be known. I didn't, at the time, think anything could come of it, though, as I did not have very high self-esteem and just thought she wasn't interested. The only way I was convinced she was interested was because of one of her good friends, Sarah.</p> 

<p class="bjq">I have a friend who worked in the deli (you guessed it, Sarah) and would often come through my line during her lunch break. During one such time, Michael was bagging at my register. From that moment on, Sarah was certain Michael was interested in me. I had my doubts. Next thing I know, Sarah brought a mutual friend, Meredith, to the store on a different night to see what she thouhgt. Meredith agreed with Sarah that Michael had feelings for me. I still had my doubts. At the very least, I thought Michael couldn't be older then seventeen. Well, he's older then he looks, I found out later.</p>

<p class="bjq">I might of made the mistake of telling my mother of the on-going debate (I do confide in her a lot). She happened to stop by Publix not long after, checked out at my register, and had Michael help her out to her car. Not even five minutes after she left the store, she sent me a text message that read, "Jailbait has the hots for you!" So what if he does? He was still too young, and while I contemplated the issue, I did nothing about it.</p>

<p>I was going to go with a friend, Alyssa, to hang out for awhile one night, and Alyssa asked her if she would like to come, considering Betty Jo was her friend as well. <def class="bjq">It was by chance that Alyssa invited me to come, I think. Regardless, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get to know MIchael outside of work, so I accepted.</def>That night she came, and we had fun. I was still nervous about asking her out, though. Right before we were about to go our seperate ways for the night, I finally asked if I could go over to her place for a little bit. <def class="bjq">I could tell Michael didn't want to go home yet, but I wasn't sure I wanted to invite him over to my apartment in the middle of the night.</def> After a little convincing she let me come over.</p>

<p><def class="bjq">Be it empathy, stupidity, or serendipity... I decided to let Michael follow me back to my apartment. We talked and watched a movie. It was then that I think we met each other truly,</def> and we have been very happy since!
