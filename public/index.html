<p>5/18/09: The 'Meet the Bride' and 'Meet the Groom' pages have been set up! Hopefully I'll be able to put a nice picture on each page soon. The 'How We Met' page is next on my agenda, so keep checking in!</p>

<p>4/10/09: Spring Break came and went, and I (obviously) never finished the rest of the website. Part of it is that I want Michael to contribute, and he never finished writing it out. But I never started my part anyway! Oh well, hopefully it'll get done by the wedding! - Betty Jo</p>

<p>3/4/09: If you've visited our site before, you may have noticed that it isn't complete. I plan on getting all pages up by next Monday.  We also upgraded our account, so they'll be no more annoying ads. Don't forget to visit our guestbook! -Betty Jo</p> 

<p>Finally! -our site is up and functional.  There may be a few bugs in it still, so if you find any, please let my know using the contact link <a href="#email">below</a>.</p>

<p>We've really wanted to get a laptop as a second computer, but don't have the money for it right now, especially the one we really want. We've wanted to get a <a href="macbk.html">MacBook Pro</a>. We know this is alot, but it never hurts to ask as long as you don't expect anything!</p>
